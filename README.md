# Getting Started with AudioStack Discography App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Scope for Extensions
I had the following in mind as extensions to the current work done
1) The history functionality to navigate back through the application can be an extension to the work done now
2) Have added sample tests for components and API files, this can be extended through the application for extensive coverage
3) Adding Loaders during API calls can be added further
4) Debounce functionality for the autocomplete search bar can be added as an extension

### Vercel 
I've deployed the app on vercel and the link to it is as follows

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
